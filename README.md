# FBXWalkthrough
FBX Walkthrough Project for Programming Internship.

This project provides design and construction students with a powerful platform to create interactive FBX models and explore them in an eye-level walk-through environment. By allowing students to see their designs as if they were physically inside them, the tool promotes a deeper understanding of spatial relationships, construction challenges, and overall design effectiveness. This hands-on experience helps bridge the gap between 2D drawings and real-world structures, enhancing communication, collaboration, and learning outcomes in design and construction education.
